GearSwap-Jobs
=============

Repository for GearSwap lua files for various jobs

To use any of these job luas, you must include the various Mote-* files:
Mote-Include
Mote-Utility
Mote-Globals
Mote-Mappings
Mote-SelfCommands

These files -may- be included in the /libs folder of GearSwap, but if not, place them in the data directory with the rest of your job files.

For documentation on how to use these lua scripts, please read the wiki: https://github.com/Kinematics/GearSwap-Jobs/wiki

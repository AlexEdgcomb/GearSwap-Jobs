GearSwap-Jobs
=============

Repository for GearSwap lua files for various jobs

To use any of these job luas, you must include the various Mote-* files:
Mote-Include
Mote-Utility
Mote-Globals
Mote-Mappings
Mote-SelfCommands

These files -may- be included in the /libs folder of GearSwap, but if not, place them in the data directory with the rest of your job files.
